Have you ever wondered how banks/credit card companies plan their finances for their future? They may encounter a new set of people defaulting on their payments every month. They need to have a predictive model to help them with this information that will let them plan their finances strategically. We aim to predict if a person will default on his upcoming monthâ€™s credit card payment based on parameters such as Credit limit, sex, education level, marital status, age, and past 6 months payment history.

Questions / Goals We first plan on performing EDA and get a sense of the data and other interesting patterns/ information. Our primary goal is to use different supervised classification methods and compare their results. We also aim to perform clustering analysis which may reveal segments such as (High Credit Limit, Low Risk) Individuals, (High Credit Limit, High Risk) Individuals, (Low Credit Limit, Low Risk) Individuals, (Low Credit Limit, High Risk) individuals, / Responsible Payers, Delayed Payers, etc. Hypothesis: People who did not pay their bill the majority of the times in the past 6 months will default the next month irrespective of their age, sex, marital status, etc Hypothesis: People with a higher credit are less likely to default

Algorithms: We plan on using the following algorithms: Supervised: KNN Classification Decision Trees / Random Forest Logistic Regression Naive Bayes

Unsupervised: K Means Clustering

Note: Used algorithms are subject to change.

Project Description
This project aims to predict credit card payment defaults using factors like credit limit, demographics, and past payment history, utilizing a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It will compare various supervised classification algorithms such as KNN, Decision Trees/Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and employ K Means Clustering for customer segmentation. The goal is to identify patterns that indicate the likelihood of default, assisting financial institutions in risk management and strategic planning.
